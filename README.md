# Strapi application

This is a React app using Strapi as a custom CMS. The content of the app (blog posts and images of paintings) is manipulated by the Strapi CMS admin panel. You can take a look of the static site with dummy data [here](https://5ee94ebd2c95c28a018cc001--jovana-painter-static.netlify.app/).
